# 📈 MT5 Trading Bridge - Streamlit Web Interface

A **web-based trading interface** built with **Streamlit** and **Python**, designed to connect directly to MetaTrader 5 platform for seamless trading operations with advanced position management and filtering capabilities.

This tool enables traders to execute trades, monitor positions, and manage their MT5 account through an intuitive web interface with real-time updates and intelligent filtering.

I developed it to help others understand how to create a proper trading dashboard and, obviously, how to use the MT5 Python API to access account information and execute trades.

## 🌐 Deployment Note

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This application requires **MetaTrader 5** which is **Windows-only** software. Therefore:
- ❌ **Cannot be hosted on Streamlit Cloud** (uses Linux servers)
- ✅ **Can be hosted locally** on Windows machines
- ✅ **Can be deployed on Windows VPS** (Contabo, Hostinger, Azure)
- ✅ **Can be shared via ngrok** for remote access

See [Installation & Deployment](#-installation--deployment) section for detailed setup instructions.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Problem**: "❌ MT5 initialization failed"
- **Solution**: Ensure MT5 terminal is running and logged in
- Check that Python and MT5 are same architecture (both 32-bit or 64-bit)

**Problem**: "❌ Login failed"
- **Solution**: Verify account number, password, and server name
- Check MT5 terminal can connect to broker server
- Confirm account allows API connections (check broker settings)

### Order Execution Errors

- **Solution**: Check symbol name spelling (e.g., EURUSD not EUR/USD)
- Ensure symbol is available in MT5 Market Watch
- Right-click Market Watch → Show All to enable symbol

**Problem**: Order fails with retcode error
- **Solution**: Check available margin for position size
- Verify market is open (avoid weekends/holidays)
- Reduce position size if insufficient margin
- Check broker's minimum lot size requirements

### Position Management Issues

**Problem**: Positions not appearing in filtered view
- **Solution**: Verify comment matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check "Filter enabled" checkbox is checked
- Click manual refresh button

**Problem**: Cannot close position

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Does this work with MT4?**  
A: The library is called MetaTrader5 but it can connect to both MT4 and MT5 platforms. Just ensure you have the Python API enabled.

**Q: Can I use this on Mac or Linux?**  
A: No, MetaTrader 5 is Windows-only. You would need a Windows VM or VPS.

**Q: Is my trading data secure?**  
A: All connections are local to your machine. If using ngrok, traffic is tunneled securely. Never share your ngrok URL publicly.

**Q: Can I automate trading strategies with this?**  
A: This tool is designed for manual trading via web interface. For automation, consider developing an Expert Advisor (EA) in MQL5.

**Q: Does it work with all brokers?**  
A: Yes, as long as your broker supports MetaTrader 5 and allows API connections. Check with your broker if unsure.

**Q: What happens if my internet disconnects?**  
A: Open positions remain in MT5. The web interface will show connection errors until internet is restored.

**Q: Can multiple users access the same app?**  
A: Yes with ngrok or VPS deployment, but all users will control the SAME MT5 account. Use with caution.

**Q: How do I enable MT5 API access?**  
A: In MT5 terminal: Tools → Options → Expert Advisors → Check "Allow automated trading"
